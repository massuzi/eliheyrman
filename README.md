# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm **Eli Heyrman** — a process-focused consultant with a passion for trading, data analysis, and automation.

With a background in economics, quality systems (ISO 9001/14001), and IT tools like Python, Power Automate, and SharePoint, I help businesses streamline operations and make decisions based on structured insights.

In my free time, I apply the same structured mindset to trading — building self-review tools and automated journaling systems to improve consistency and eliminate emotional bias.

## 📂 Featured Project

### 📔 Discord Trading Journal Automation

This project automates my personal trade journaling system using Discord as the input platform and Excel as the analytical output.

**How it works:**
- Each asset (e.g. BTC, ES, NQ) has its own private Discord channel
- I log each trade manually via structured messages
- The script:
  - Reads each message, extracts key data (direction, outcome, profit, risk, etc.)
  - Captures the timestamp to enable time-based tracking
  - Includes the link to the chart image (e.g. from ATAS or TradingView)
  - Outputs everything into Excel: one row per trade, per asset

This gives me insight into:
- ✅ Setup consistency
- ✅ Win rate by session, hour, or day
- ✅ R-multiples and expectancy over time
- ✅ Time-of-day performance
- ✅ Visual validation via embedded chart links
